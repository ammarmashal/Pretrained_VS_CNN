# Pretrained Model Comparison: MobileNetV2 vs. ResNet50 vs. Custom CNN
This repository presents a comparison between two popular pretrained models, MobileNetV2 and ResNet50, along with a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), applied to image classification tasks. The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance and efficiency of these models in terms of accuracy, speed, and resource consumption.
